          <h2>Liner pool installation</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          Liner pools are built by putting them in an excavated hole, after
          pouring reinforced concrete slabs, sets a frame that can be of
          different materials (in our case it is usually steel sheet), and then
          the inside of the pool is lined with a special foil (liner).
          The construction of a liner pool takes about 4 weeks. Linersky
          pools are made in over 20 dimensions, and the depths are up to 1.5 m. All
          equipment (filtration, attractions, lighting, heating...) is installed
          when assembling the pool. As in the case of other types of pools,
          of the liner, the desired equipment should be foreseen in the planning phase
          to be installed in the future, to leave the necessary installation for
          later installation. The advantage of this type of pool is the low price.

          <h2>Construction of concrete pools</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          Concrete pools are built by placing them on a concrete liner
          reinforced concrete walls are being installed. After that, it is installed
          waterproofing, and then the desired finishing material. Final
          Materials for the construction of concrete pools can be tiles (glass
          or ceramic), different coatings, or foils. According to the method of removing
          water for filtration, this type of pool is divided into skimmer and overflow
          swimming pools. Skimmer pools are those where the skimmer (opening through which
          water goes to the filter) is inside the pool, and with overflow pools
          water constantly overflows from the pool and goes into the underground concrete
          tank, under or next to the pool, from where it goes on to filtration.

          <h2>Construction of a swimming pool from ISO blocks</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          A swimming pool made of ISO blocks allows savings, not only in the time that is
          needed to build the pool but also in money. The main advantage of this
          construction system is the ease of use: after placing the concrete
          slabs, blocks are stacked, reinforced, and then concrete is poured into them.
          In addition to being cheaper than a classic concrete pool, this system
          construction is faster and easier, and at the same time cleaner for the environment. Thanks to
          the shapes of ISO blocks (rectangular and bent) can be used to create a swimming pool
          of any form. The blocks also have excellent thermal insulation properties,
          so the heat release is about 10 times less due to the presence of air
          within the material.

          Hydro massage tubs can be built-in, if they are installed on the floor, and they can

          the terrace, veranda, or winter garden. Freestanding bathtubs have a larger one
          the possibility of positioning, and their additional advantage is that you can
          take them with you if you move to a new house. All hot tubs
          are equipped with massage pumps, water heaters, and control panels,

                  href="https://blog.d-impex.co.rs/odrzavanje-bazena.html">extends the life of pools</a>, and for
                certain types, such as liner pools, the pool lining or liner can be replaced after a certain period,
                significantly extending their period of use. Expect your pool to last longer if you do everything as
                intended for the type of pool you choose from the start, without compromising on the quality of
                materials and equipment. Like any other property, a pool needs regular maintenance, occasionally
                repairing some worn-out segments or parts of equipment, which will also enable longer use.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>When a pool is made of concrete, waterproofing of the wall surface must be done by applying
                waterproofing materials that ensure that water from the pool will not penetrate the walls and thereby
                seep out, which can cause a range of problems with both pool equipment and construction. It is essential
                to ensure that the pool basin does not leak in any way.</p>
              <p>There are also special paints for painting pool walls that do not allow water to pass through and can
                be used as a finishing material. It will occasionally be necessary to recoat the wall surface with these
                waterproof coatings because these materials are also exposed to the influence of <a

                  construction</a> consists of several phases, from planning, designing, preparing the site, carrying
                out construction works, making plumbing and electrical installations, constructing a machinery room,
                final or finishing pool lining and equipping the pool basin, as well as installing the equipment
                necessary for operation, water purification, and disinfection. It's hard for any company or individual
                to carry out all these works without engaging subcontractors, at least for some of these phases.
                Usually, these are construction works. So, our company handles all other phases, except for construction
                works, from start to finish, including commissioning and user training on how to operate the equipment
                and maintain the pool.</p>
              <p>So, we only hire local contractors for excavation and rough construction works, as this minimizes costs
                per user and is the most justified logistically.</p>

                in
                order for the efficiency of this equipment to be maximized.</p>
              <p>For this purpose, a part of the garage, basement, or some shed with dimensions of 2.5x1.5m can be used,

              <p>Unlike the times when a pool was a luxury affordable only to the wealthy, today it is an investment

                large part of the population can afford, and the price varies depending on the type of pool and level of
                equipment. Of course, the construction method, accessibility of the yard for construction operations,
                but
                also a number of other factors that determine <a

                For some simpler forms and levels of equipment, this price ranges from 5,000 - 6,000 euros, and for
                larger,
                more demanding, and equipped pools made of durable materials, the price ranges from 10,000 - 20,000
                euros.

              <p>With good planning, some phases can be done later if their subsequent installation is anticipated in

              <p>During pool construction, there is a phase in which a hole is dug for the pool, creating a temporary

                of soil that must be removed and taken away from the construction site or stored in such a way that the
                same
                soil can be later used to fill the hole around the pool and, if the owner wishes, spread around the yard
                to
                improve and better shape the area around the pool. This fact also affects the price of pool construction
                because it creates additional costs, the so-called 'collateral damage', as the soil needs to be removed
                from
                the yard sometimes to a slightly more distant location where it can be safely disposed of.</p>

                and

              <p>Fortunately for pool users, building pools in Serbia does not require any special permits. However,
                when
                building a concrete pool, which is considered a permanent structure and occupies a significant portion
                of
                the yard, it is advisable to consult with an architect because when constructing a new structure,
                approval
                from the relevant authorities regarding the occupation of the plot where it is being built is required.
                In
                all other situations, this will not be necessary, especially since most pools are considered
                prefabricated-demountable structures. No permits of any kind are required for prefabricated-demountable
                structures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, it is advisable, during the planning phase, to consult with an architect regarding
                technical
                capabilities and soil stability at the pool construction site. Keep in mind that some types of pools,
                especially large ones, exert a pressure of 50 - 100 tons when filled with water.

                durable, but their construction is also the most expensive. When building a concrete pool, you can
                combine
                shapes, sometimes narrower, sometimes wider, you can combine depths, shallower in some parts for
                children,
                and deeper in others, you can create a seating bench in the water, a bar, partition off a section for a

              <p>In order for swimmers to enjoy the pool and its amenities, it is necessary to provide space next to the
                pool to be used as a beach, as well as for the stay of those who do not swim but want to be near the
                swimmers, for sun loungers, towels, or just for parents to supervise small children in the water. The
                most
                popular options are DECKING, imitations of wooden decking, which look very nice around the pool, are
                easy
                to maintain, quick to dry, and comfortable to walk, sit, or lie on. Concrete slabs are also quite common

                environment around the pool, so together it can be very nicely designed without the cost of beach
                construction being high.

              <p>When planning a pool and having pets, keep them away from the pool; they are curious, water attracts
                them,
                especially dogs. It often happens that they jump into the water and cannot get out. If owners are not
                nearby to help them, problems can arise. It is also not good for pets to contaminate the water in which
                children and perhaps older and more sensitive people will swim. Also, if young children are not

                Installing some type of protective fence is not part of the basic pool construction package, but if you

              <p>Regarding safety features, it is necessary to know that the prescribed depth according to European
                standards for residential pools is 1.5m and if you build a pool deeper than that, you must have a
                lifeguard
                license. This is the most important fact when it comes to the safety of swimmers. Also, non-slip
                materials
                should be used around the pool because walking and running on wet surfaces result in the highest number
                of
                injuries and falls, which we want to avoid.
              </p>

                Installing a protective barrier for children and pets is also desirable, and pay attention to the steps
                for
                entering the pool, which in themselves always pose a potential risk of injury.

                course, replace some things that have simply worn out. Renovation typically involves replacing the

                environmental influences bring impurities, fungi, and bacteria into the water that multiply very
                quickly, so maintaining the water in the pool is necessary. During the bathing season, the water should
                be filtered daily using a pump and filter, as well as treated with various chemicals. <a

                maintain your pool, the water would quickly become cloudy, dirty, and thus unsafe for swimming. To
                ensure your pool provides pleasure and enjoyment, you need to take care of it, both the water itself and
                the equipment used to operate the pool and disinfect it. Regular checking of the functionality and

                the process of maintaining pool water in proper condition for bathing.</p>
              <p>There are also some chemicals that are used less frequently or very rarely, so we'll discuss them some
                other time.</p>

              <p>In <a href="https://blog.d-impex.co.rs/pool-maintenance.html#s4">pool winterization</a>, a part of the
                water is drained and in spring fresh clean water is added, which is quite enough to be able to
                constantly use the same water in the pool with proper handling. Of course, if the water gets so dirty
                due to factors beyond your control, it's better to discard such water, refill the pool with clean fresh
                drinking water that you can easily maintain.</p>
              <p>It's important to occasionally rinse the pool water filter.</p>

                through the skimmer, and saturate the filter with dirt. Therefore, it is necessary to remove them before
                they start to decompose and cause water cloudiness, change its pH value, or create dirty sediment at the

              <p>For <a href="https://blog.d-impex.co.rs/pool-covers.html">pool covering</a>, there are several options,
                the most popular of which is the THERMAL COVER. It's a soft nylon cover that is manually rolled onto a
                shaft, very lightweight and floats on the water surface. In this way, it protects the water from
                mechanical impurities, prevents water evaporation, and thus loss of heat and chemicals from the water.
                There are also covers made of rigid materials, as well as DOMES, also called SLIDING ROOF SEGMENTAL
                COVERS.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>You can vacuum your pool in two ways, with a MECHANICAL VACUUM cleaner, which is usually provided with
                the pool, and with an AUTOMATIC ROBOTIC VACUUM cleaner, which you can buy when you get tired of manual
                vacuuming. The first method involves a long hose that is connected to the skimmer, connected to a vacuum
                brush, and lowered to the bottom of the pool using a telescopic pole, then gently pulled along the
                bottom to pick up the dirt that has settled and carried away through the hose and skimmer into the
                filter. Automatic vacuums have their dirt retention chamber, which you empty and wash after vacuuming,
                all other processes with the robot are automatic, just lower it into the water and plug it in, it does
                everything by itself, some models clean the walls of the pool as well.</p>

              <p>Sometimes impurities appear in the water that are very fine, so the filter cannot stop them because
                they are finer than the sand grain size in the filter, they are usually not dangerous for bathing, but
                they lead to water cloudiness. If your pool water becomes cloudy, do not despair, vacuum your pool,
                rinse the filter, skimmer nets, and pool pump, test the water for pH and CHLORINE and add 1 to 2 liters
                of FLOCCULANT. After 48 hours, check the condition of the water and then dose the chemicals according to
                the values you obtained by measuring. After another 24 hours, the water should clear up. The pool pump
                should run continuously for the first 24 hours, and then in a regular operating mode via the timer.</p>

              <p>When planning a pool, if you have pets, keep them away from the pool, they are curious, water attracts
                them, especially dogs. However, they often jump into the water but cannot get out. If owners are not
                nearby to help them, an unfortunate accident can occur. It's also not good for pets to contaminate the
                water in which children, and perhaps older and more sensitive people, will bathe. The water gets dirty,
                and hairs and other impurities from pets remain, so bathing them in your pool is not recommended.</p>

                based on the size of the pool?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>During the bathing season, it is necessary to filter the water in the pool every day. For the water to
                be clean, it must pass through the filter at least 3-4 times during the day. The question arises, how
                will you calculate how many hours of filtration this is. You will multiply the volume of water in your
                pool by 4 and divide the number you get by the power of your pump. For example, if your pool is 8 x 4
                meters, the volume of water is 8 x 4 x 1.5 (pool depth) = 48 cubic meters. Then multiply the volume by
                4, we get: 48 x 4 = 192. If your pump has a capacity of 12 cubic meters per hour, divide 192 by 12 = 16.
                This means that with a pump of this capacity, for a pool of this size, filtration should run for 16
                hours a day. So, you choose the pump according to its capacity, how much water per hour it can pump
                through the filter without having to run most of the time, using the above instructions by dividing the
                volume of your pool by several different pump powers and when you get somewhere around 12-16 hours the
                pump runs and 8-12 hours it pauses, you have the answer to this question.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>You can find out more about this topic on our blog, which specifically addresses this important
                question and describes in detail the procedure for preparing your pool for the bathing season, but here
                are the most important instructions briefly.
                Cleaning and preparing the pool for the start of the season involves removing impurities that have
                accumulated in the pool during the winter and topping up the pool with fresh clean water. Then it is
                necessary to do a "shock" treatment of the water by dissolving Chlorine granules in a container with
                water and pouring the dissolved chlorine into the pool. Leave it to act for 48 hours with the pump
                running continuously for filtration. After that, test the water to check the pH value and chlorine
                level. If the water is green, add Algaecide. It is also necessary to regularly maintain the water to
                keep it in proper bacteriological and stable alkaline condition throughout the bathing season.</p>
